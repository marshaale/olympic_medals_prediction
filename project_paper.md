## Problem statement and motivation

Predicting olympic medal and country candidates for countries attend to olympic.

Motivation fun sports.

## Dataset and preprocessing

- **Source:** [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?select=athlete_events.csv) (basic bio data on athletes and medal results from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016).
- **Size:** ~271116 rows, 15 columns.

Implemented two step data processing first step [pre-clean](../dataset/processed/pre_clean.csv)simple handling age,height,weight missing value then feature extraction based year and season olympic event.

[File](../notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb)

List of features

```py
features_cols = [
  "noc",
  "season",
  "year",
  "athletes",
  "athletes_female_percentage",
  "avg_age",
  "agv_height",
  "avg_weight",
  "prev_medals",
  "prev_gold_medals",
  "sports",
  "events",
  "total_medals",
];
```

Second step [clean-dataset](../dataset/processed/clean_athlete_events.csv) handling missing models replace 0 because NA models equal to zero.
encoding categorical season feature with label/binary encoding.
tried iqr capping(handling outlier) and skipped due to medal features massive outliers.then inspect and save.

For scaling i will use RobustScaler which is good for handling massive outliers effectively.

## Lessons learned

Lessons i learned during this project the `data preparation` i tried different steps and still missing some.

Massive outliers between medals and athletes.

- what you would improve: The dataset improvement is what needs to improve and clustering
- key takeaways: trying what i learned and implement based on my decisions.
